# Lab Two - Signalling with Semaphores

## Description
It need to create a program that must create at least two threads where one thread signals the other using a common Semaphore.
We will need the following files to complete this lab.

- **Semaphore.h** The header file for the Semaphore class. This file is provided for your use. Make sure you understand how it works.
- **Semaphore.cpp** The implementation file for the Semaphore class. This file is provided for your use. Make sure you understand how it works.
- **main.cpp** The file containing the main function. This main function must create at least two threads where one thread signals the other using a common Semaphore. In this lab this is where all your code will go.
- **Makefile** This is the project file. It contains rules that tell the system how to compile the code and produce a working executable called **signal**.
- **Doxyfile** This file contains the settings for the Doxygen tool. It is generated by the doxygen program when run for the first time.

## Eexcution
There is a Makefile we can use to compile the c++ source code of this program within exercises. you can do like this:
```
$ make
```
and then you can run the executable program with the command:
```
$ ./signal
```
If you want to clean the target object of the c++ source code compilation, you can do like this:
```
$ make CLEAN
```

## Debugger
There is a dugger command within linux.

- gdb commands
  - list [number]: list the source code arround the specific number line.

  - list : list the source code of the specific function.

  - run: to run the executable file with debug mode

  - break : add the breakpoint at the specific function name

  - break [number]: add the breakpoint at the specific number line.

  - next: execute the next line code.

  - step: if the code line is function, then enter the function.
